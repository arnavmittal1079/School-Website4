            School canteen facility aims to provide children of working parents to buy nutritious and healthy food at
            competitive prices during the school day. Meals are either cooked on the premises or bought from approved
            restaurants and food outlets.Too many food options can lead to poor food choices for students who may be
            overwhelmed with their new
            freedom to choose what they eat for lunch. Parents may be the ones putting money on their students' lunch
            cards, but they often know little about the foods their children select.

        <h4>Implemented Online Attendence Management System</h4>
        <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5-col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            Below are 9 features you should look for in a time and attendance module.
            <br><br>
            1. Clocking In and Out

            Let’s start with the most obvious and important feature. Needless to say, the main purpose of a time and
            attendance module is to allow employees to clock in and out easily and keep a record of their working hours.
            Options should include magnetic card readers, PIN numbers or even biometric scanners that identifies
            employees’ fingerprints.
            <br><br>
            2. Flexible Employee Scheduling

            Some businesses offer flexible schedules that allow employees to start and end their days at different
            times. Others prefer to keep the workday more organised with a synchronized work schedule.
            <br><br>
            A good time and attendance system goes beyond its basic functions of monitoring the punctuality (or
            otherwise) of your employees. The software should allow you to create and manage multiple schedules and
            rosters. Such functionality should also come equipped with features that alert you of any tardy or AWOL
            employees .
            <br><br>
            3. Absence Management

            Apart from monitoring your workforce’s attendance, a competent time and attendance system should help manage
            absence. Even if the absenteeism is unexpected due to illness, leaves or last minute – it should be easy for
            managers to see at a glance who’s in, who isn’t, and what each person’s entitled overtime and allowances
            are.
            <br><br>
            4. Payroll Integration

            Assuming your payroll process has been automated, your time and attendance module should also be able to
            integrate seamlessly into your payroll functionality; it can provide accurate attendance data for the
            payroll cycle that can be used to rapidly and accurately calculate salary and other benefits. This, of
            course, can only be achieved when you have an integrated solution.
            <br><br>
            Without a full HRMS in place, there will be a possibility that data will be lost between steps from
            timekeeping to payroll. For instance; if the individual processing payroll is unaware that an employee has
            been terminated, an incorrect final payment may be processed. Such information should be readily available
            for the employee, the manager, and Human Resource management to prevent any possible errors.
            <br><br>
            5. Compliance

            In the context of Singapore, labor legislation and regulations probably lay down the maximum number of
            working hours. The time and attendance system should monitor breaks on your behalf, using that data for
            reporting and compliance purposes, and provide automatic notifications if break patterns are not meeting the
            legislative norms.
            <br><br>
            6. Mobile

            These days, an organisation’s workforce is much more likely to be scattered, with some employees working in
            the field, from home, or elsewhere. A mobile version of your time and attendance software should allow
            employees to clock in through their mobile devices. This will provide you with an overview of the hours
            worked by the whole workforce and not only of employees that are ‘on-premises’. Mobile apps may also include
            GPS tracking systems for worker safety or location monitoring.
            <br><br>
            7. Elimination of Missed Punches

            Old fashioned punch clocks were prone human error. It was easy for an employee to return from lunch and
            begin work, forgetting to stop by the time clock to punch in. By the time error was realized, it may have
            been at the end of the shift. A manager would then be required to verify the correct working hours of the
            employee. Modernized HR management systems are designed to alert the manager and the employee of a missed
            punch-in through self-service portals and mobile alerts. This will eliminate any chance of a missed
            punch-in.
            <br><br>
            8. Comprehensive Policy Configuration

            As regulated under Part IV of Employment Act, your employees are entitled to breaks, overtime pay and rest
            day. Either you have a group of employees who are entitled to overtime or other employees who are entitled
            to time off, your ideal Time and Attendance system should be able to cater to such scenarios.
            <br><br>
            9. Reporting

            Finally, your time and attendance software should be able to provide tailored reports and analytics using
            the system’s data. Expect your software to give you the information to various attendance-related reports,
            offering insights into hours worked, shift patterns, and so on with a view to constantly improving
            productivity.
